*“the grasshopper drags itself along and desire is no longer
stirred... the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit
returns to God who gave it. “Meaningless! Meaningless!”..."Everything
is meaningless!’”* Ecclesiastes 12:5-8, New Intl. Version

Grasshopper: How do I find my purpose?  
Master: What is the purpose of this river?    
Grasshopper:  Master, please answer my original question.  
Master: I answered your question.  
Grasshopper: No, now I have two questions which I’m confused
about. That’s one more than where I started.  
Master: Are you having this question or is this question having you?  
Grasshopper: Master, please answer my question.   
Master: Are you experiencing anger?  
Grasshopper: No, I’m not angry.   
Master: Observe the anger.  
Grasshopper: I’m not angry.  
Master: Observe the resistance to anger.  
Grasshopper: I’m NOT ANGRY.  
Master: Once upon a time there was a zebra. He did not know his 
purpose and so wandered about a forest. He asked a tree - 
what is your purpose? The tree did not respond. He asked 
the sky - what is your purpose? The sky did not respond. 
He asked the sun - what is your purpose? The sun did not 
respond. And then, the zebra realized he was asking the 
wrong question. It is said that at that very moment, the 
zebra found enlightenment.   
Grasshopper:  What? He just walked into the forest, made noises to the sun and sky, and became enlightened? 
Master: Yes.   
Grasshopper:  What happened then?  
Master: I happened to be hungry and so I ate him.   
Grasshopper:  I see. At least tell me, Master, what was the right
question?  
Master: What do you mean?  
Grasshopper: You said he was asking the wrong question, what was the
right one?  
Master: If I tell you that, young grasshopper, what fun will it be
finding your purpose?
