What is left to see for he who  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   has seen the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      light behind your eyes,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   heard the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      laugh behind your eyes,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   felt the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Life behind your eyes.

Blink fast, my dear,  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lest a moment pass  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without this  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    love behind your eyes.
