By the time she answers the door,  
the neighbors have left.  
Words dribble from her mouth to no one  
and she tumbles, from door to bed and back again,  
one foot deaf to the step of the other.  
She trips over packed boxes and  
stays on the floor,  
her lips touching the tile.  
Is it time to move out?  
For the second time this month,  
the hardness does not reply.
