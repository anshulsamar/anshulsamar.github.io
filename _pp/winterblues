Oh tear of mine,<br>    
you've traveled far from home<br>    
to come and talk.<br>      
      <br>
Am I still sad?<br>      
It's been so long.<br>      
Perhaps I've just forgot.<br>      
      <br>
What summer's like,<br>      
the empty skies,<br>      
and I wonder why I've got<br>      
 <br>     
these winter blues<br>      
and quiet nights<br>      
and clouds between my thoughts.<br>      
<br>      
But nothing lasts,<br>      
it never has,<br>      
and the peace I've always sought<br>      
      <br>
Is there with me<br>      
The seasons change but<br>      
inside, I am not.<br>      
   <br>   
I cannot fall,<br>      
so tear of mine,<br>      
no need to be so fraught.<br>      
      <br>
I'll be okay<br>      
I'm here with you <br>    
I'll catch you when you drop.<br>
