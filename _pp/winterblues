Oh tear of mine,  
you've traveled far from home  
to come and talk.  
  
Am I still sad?  
It's been so long.  
Perhaps I've just forgot.  
  
What summer's like,  
the empty skies,  
and I wonder why I've got  
  
these winter blues  
and quiet nights  
and clouds between my thoughts.  
  
But nothing lasts,  
it never has,  
and the peace I've always sought  
  
Is there with me  
The seasons change but  
inside, I am not.  
  
I cannot fall,  
so tear of mine,  
no need to be so fraught.  
  
I'll be okay  
I'm here with you  
I'll catch you when you drop.
