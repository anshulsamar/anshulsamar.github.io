From 10/19/2005, Collins elementary school days!

I gently touch,  
My pen to the paper  
And wait for the magic to start  

My heart starts beating  
First slowly, and then fast  
Sending thoughts and ideas through my veins  

Those signals reach my hand  
And my hand vibrates, moving the pen  
In a rhythmic motion across the paper  

My feelings and emotions  
Suddenly pour out  
And lightly drizzle down on to my words  

Then my soul escapes  
From my body  
And breaks into tiny pieces  

Those delicate pieces fall  
Into the depths of my writing  
And make each and every word special to me  

My pen leaks  
And black ink  
Slowly soaks into my words giving them power and strength  

I become a part of my poem  
And my poem becomes a part of me
