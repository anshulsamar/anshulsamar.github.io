Here,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you can keep  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart tonight

as I sit to write  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   in a world so fierce  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      that when arrows fly to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   try and pierce this chest,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Iâ€™ll think of you and fight.

I brave my pen  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   on these rocky fields,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      these thoughts my guide  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   and words my shield,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      and when I hear men roar,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I do not stop to fear.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      For what can they even take from me?

My heart is with you  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   and spirit free, and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      What a strength that is,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      What a strength that is,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      What a strength you are tonight.
