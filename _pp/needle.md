I thought,  
that at least by graduation,  
some teacher, somewhere,  
would have called me over  
and handed me a compass,  
but the closest Iâ€™ve come to   
finding my way  
is a needle and string   
and some absent minded words  
about the purpose of life.  
"Follow your heart."  
"Be yourself."  
Thanks,
but this is hard for me,
I say. 
How can I be myself,  
without first knowing who I am?
