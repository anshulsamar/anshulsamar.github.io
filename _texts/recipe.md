Ingredients:  
1/2 spoon* of dhania powder.   
Couple pieces of this thing. 
Two nice pinches of haldi. Not little, should be nice pinches.  
Ask neighborhood aunty for some kadi patta, woh likely kanjoos hai toh bahut kam deygi, jitney deygi utney daldena. Crush and add.     
Enough ghee, ghee is must
1 spoon* salt, although probably more than this (Thank you Richa for this tip). 
Same amount of lal mirchi as you used for the other recipe.  
   
Do this in the same way as normal tadka, except very important nothing burns and food comes out tasty.  Make it properly.  
   
Enjoy.  

**This is neither a teaspoon or a tablespoon, but rather a very unique sized spoon that I have been using for many years and all my recipes are based off of this one particular spoon. Itâ€™s most likely not available anywhere else.*.
