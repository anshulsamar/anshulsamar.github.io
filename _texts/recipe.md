Ingredients:  

1/2 spoon of dhania powder (this is neither a teaspoon nor a tablespoon, but rather a very unique sized spoon that I have been using for many years and all my recipes are based off of this one particular spoon. Itâ€™s most likely not available anywhere else*)   
Couple pieces of this thing.  
1/2 spoon salt, 1/2 spoon mirchi, and 3 nice pinches of haldi.  
Once ghee is ready, mix it in it properly.   
Add this to boiled aadha cup of moong dal (my aadha is 3/4 not 1/2).   
Use the cup your dad drinks chai from that has the handle broken for measurement.    
Enjoy. eat properly you are losing weight.
