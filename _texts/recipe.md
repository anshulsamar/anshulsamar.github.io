Ingredients:  
1/2 spoon* of dhania powder. 
Two nice pinches of haldi. Not little, should be nice pinches. 
Little powdered clove. 
Enough ghee (this is must). 
Grandmother’s special masala (I have packed this for you already). Use only thoda, this has to last you some time. 
1 spoon* salt, although probably more than this. But also not too much because if you add more than this, then it will likely become salty.  (Thank you Richa for this tip) 
Same amount of lal mirchi as you used for the other recipe from two weeks ago. 
Couple pieces of this thing you can put into ghee. 
  
Do this in the same way as normal tadka, except very important that nothing burns and food comes out tasty.  Make it properly.

Enjoy. 

*This is neither a teaspoon or a tablespoon, but rather a very unique sized spoon that I have been using for many years and all my recipes are based off of this one particular spoon. It’s most likely not available anywhere else.*.
