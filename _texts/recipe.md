Ingredients:  

1/2 spoon* of dhania powder (*This is neither a teaspoon nor a tablespoon, but rather a very unique sized spoon that I have been using for many years and all my recipes are based off of this one particular spoon. Itâ€™s most likely not available anywhere else*)   
Couple pieces of this thing.  
3 nice pinches of haldi.  
Same amount of laal mirchi and salt as you used for the other recipe.  
Make it properly in ghee. 
Add this to boiled 3/4 cup of moong dal. Use the cup your dad drinks chai from that has the handle broken. 
My 3/4th is more like 4/5ths than 3/4th. 
Enjoy.
