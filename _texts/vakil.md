When the entirety of a lecture involves a renowned mathematician
doodling around the letter “T”, you know you’re in one of those “once
in a lifetime” classes.

It is rare in the context of a humanities class to talk about
infinity, prove the famous Delphian problem (why you can never square
a circle using a straightedge and compass), or use set theory to prove
why two types of infinities exist. Rarer is that such discussions
occur weekly in a class of 15 frosh, a fantastic philosophy and
writing instructor (Ruth Starkman) and a brilliant mathematician (Ravi
Vakil).  Professor Vakil has a knack for teaching and a hunger for
“experiments” when it comes to education. Part of Stanford’s newest
Education as a Self Fashioning program, his class not only fulfills
humanities requirements but might be one of the only classes in the
world that finds Plato’s Meno in the same syllabus as Terence Tao’s
Einstein Series Lecture, Godel Escher Bach, and lecture series by
famous historians and public intellectuals including Anthony Grafton,
Alexander Nehamas, and Peter Galison.

What do we learn? If you peek at our notes and problem sets, we are
learning proof based mathematics, basic number and set theory, and how
using basic principles of math, one can prove a claim to be true or
false. We're also debating philosophy and researching on any topic of
our choosing (as long as it is related to "Godel Escher Bach"). The
class is called “Rigorous and Precise Thinking In Mathematics” and
we’re learning - or relearning - precisely that. How to think.

What intrigues me about this class is how beautiful proofs are and how
we can use language to express truths about itself. More than one
discussion has ended with a "mind blown" feeling - something that
makes any class worth the sweat and blood.

One might be frightened by the math prerequisites for this class,
because there aren't any. We started from the absolute
basics. Professor Vakil asked, "What is a number?" And someone
replied, "well, the number 1 is like - 1 apple." Another added that
the absence of an apple creates all of the negative integers and we
went from there.  Our proofs have included proving why square root of
2 is irrational, why we can think of 1 as .99999 repeating, and why
you can never map the set of integers to the set of real numbers
(proving that two different types of infinities indeed do exist).

The type of thinking is trhilling - defined, precise, from step A to step B,
and coupled with the risky jumps one takes when trying to crack at a proof. (Something both Jordan Ellenberg and Ravi Vakil relate
to <a href="https://believermag.com/the-last-great-problem/">mountain climbing</a>).

There is magic in the conversations we have with Prof. Vakil and TA
Otis Chodosh. The lectures are dialectics and explorations. Our
curiosity is piqued and rather than show us the beauty of math,
Prof. Vakil has us discover it for ourselves. I knew nothing of proof
based mathematics coming in and I happily find myself asking questions
about things that I had normally stopped asking questions about by the
time I had turned 6.

Why does the world work this way? And how can I prove it?

Thanks for a great class. To see the problem sets, check out the
