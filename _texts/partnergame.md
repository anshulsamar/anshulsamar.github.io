As a South Asian young man, you can go from being the loved child to an
unmarried disgrace, literally overnight. Last year, my
grandparents were visiting from India, and I
went to Trader Joe's to get juice. When I got back, my
grandpa looked at me and was like - "it's time to get Anshul married."

It was as simple as that. And the worst part was that Trader Joe's was out
of my favorite juice. 

With the topic of parternships, marriage, serious relationships, and
arranged marriage (it's like tinder but your parents swipe with you), 
becoming more frequent among friends, this game was born! The goal
is to get your friends to think about what they are
looking for in a partner(s). This is one version of the game, but feel
free to modify it to be about multiple partnerships, friendships, or
any other relationship. 

Time: 30 minutes.
2 players

Choose one person to be A and another to be B. The Partner Game
proceeds in 3 phases: “Searching,” “Proposal,” and “Selection.”

**Searching**: If you are Person A, come up with 5 attributes that
describe an ideal partner. Examples: personality traits, education,
career, income, family life, culture, religion, race, hobbies,
physical features, etc. For example, if you wish to be with a “funny
lawyer who loves travel, writing, and hates the Red Sox” that counts as 5
attributes: funny, lawyer, likes travel, likes writing, and hates the
Red Sox. Make sure these are the 5 attributes that matter most to you. In
other words, if we gathered all the people in the world that satisfy
these 5 attributes and randomly picked one person, would you be
comfortable taking whoever is chosen as your partner for life? When
you settle on your attributes, share them with Person B.

**Proposal**: If you are Person B, your job is to now to offer a proposal to Person A.  “Person A, I have a proposal here from someone
who satisfies all the qualities mentioned, but is also _____.” You can
fill in the blank with any attribute you wish. For example, “Person A,
here is a proposal for a funny lawyer who likes travel, writing, and
hates the Red Sox but is Hindu and is dead set on never having kids.” Here, your job
is to come up with proposals that really push Person A to face
whatever preferences they have for partners, as well as their own
biases and concepts surrounding marriage/parternships, family, and gender
roles. Try to get to what matters to them and what they are willing to
give up. Don’t be afraid to challenge them and their views - consider
offering proposals from a wide range of potential partners,
i.e. people of color, varying socioeconomic statuses, twice/half the
income of partner A, with a PhD, without a college degree, someone who
doesn’t get along with your parents, another who loves you but hates

**Selection**: If you are Person A, consider Person B’s proposal. True to
their word, they found someone who matches your five attributes - are
you willing to get engaged? If not, what attribute do you wish to add
and what attribute will you let go? For example, you may decide to
remove “likes art” with “open to having a family.” Share this with
Person B. Go back to Step 2 (now using the new attributes). Do this
for a total of 5 proposals.

If Person B was able to change 2 out of the 5 attributes on Person A’s
original list - Person B wins! Otherwise, Person A! Enjoy!

<p style="text-align: center;"> FAQ </p>

**Are any attributes off limits?**

Attributes should be within reason. Try to avoid vague catch all
attributes that get multiple attributes for free (i.e. “a good
person” or "makes for an amazing spouse"). Person A could, however, choose an attribute like “goes to
the gym.” This may be correlated with other attributes like “healthy,”
“non-smoking,” or “muscular.”

During the “Proposal” phase, Person B should not pick obscure
attributes. They should only pick attributes that can plausibly appear
in a non trivial portion of the human population. For example, Person
B should not offer a proposal from a deposed dictator or a <a href="https://i.imgflip.com/1v8pjg.jpg">dog</a>.

**What about age and language?**

You can assume that you and your future partner share at least one
common language and are of similar age.

**Who should I play with?**

You can play with friends - it's also fun to play with people from other
generations (like parents or grandparents) to see what they value. You
can also ask them to pick attributes for the type of person they would
hope that you marry/partner with.  

**5 variables? Picking variables which strongly correlate with others?
Attributes with lots of variance? This sounds like an optimization
problem.**

Yeah, I guess it does.

**What about finding true love?**

Feel free to play this game while you are looking for it.
