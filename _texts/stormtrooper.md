![PVC Pipe Drum]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ "/assets/stormtrooper.jpg"  }})

ME203 (Design and Manufacturing) final project. The Blueman Group
posted about it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bluemangroup/photos/pb.29300864323.-2207520000.1463188209./10154197157834324/?type=3&theater">here</a> and I got to go meet one of their band members
in Vegas! The drum was gifted to the Stanford marching band. 

Thanks to Jacob Gowan, John McMordie, Eddie Irlanda, Craig Milroy,
Dave Beach, and PRL TAs for all their help.
