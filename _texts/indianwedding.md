If you are in your mid 20s, it’s likely that your friends are getting
married. Some of those friends are brown. Some of those brown friends
are having brown weddings. And some of those brown friends having
brown weddings haven’t invited you.


It’s not your fault, you were never really close to them. But you
tried out yoga and watched Slumdog Millionaire - why not try Indian
weddings too?


When it comes to weddings, a small effort today can result in a huge
return on investment. In American weddings, one wedding gift gets you
a nice meal, maybe one dance, and a number or two. In
Indian weddings, one wedding gift gets you three
choreographed dances, five meals, and a couple potential
fiancees (if you thought your friend was a good wing man, wait till
you meet his mother). Bond yields and stock prices will rise and fall,
but Indian weddings are here to stay.



Getting into Indian weddings can be tough, but you have diversity on
your side. Indians love seeing non-Indians dance to their music and if
the bride or groom don’t have too many white friends, you’ll
automatically rise to the top of the list. In fact, one choreographed
dance number with a white friend is required for any successful
wedding.


If you choose not to dance and were never close to the bride or groom,
don’t fret. Soon, the groom’s mother will hear that “Shashi’s wedding
had 1000 attendees and drones doing the photography,” and last minute
invites will be sent to boost numbers. Good thing that you chose to
pair up with Alok on that math assignment (even though he was an
English major) - you might have failed the project, but now you'll get
an invite. Stereotyping does pay off!


If you still don’t have an invitation, crash the wedding. For those
who are brown, this part is simple. When someone asks you who you are,
say “You don’t recognize me?” and then proclaim that you are Aunt
Pooja’s son.  In social settings, there are very few things that
Indians are scared of more than meeting a relative they do not
recognize.


However, since you are white, try using a distraction. If someone
approaches you, put a hand to your stomach, pretend to be sick, and
rush to the nearest restroom. “Bichara gora,” they’ll say, “looks like
he couldn’t tolerate the food.” If they do stop and ask for your name,
reply, “Peter. We spoke last night after the dance performances?”
They’ll profusely apologize and leave you to your business. If part of
you feels offended, don’t be. It can, after all, be hard to remember
which white face belongs to which white name, let alone how to
pronounce it!


If you’ve gotten this far, then pat yourself on your back. You did
it. An upset stomach aside, everything seems to be well. Enjoy the
festivities and don’t forget to dress nicely -
they’ll want you in the pictures.
