The Model T Student
Athena, the Great Greek Goddess of Wisdom, was born inside her
father’s head (ThinkQuest).  What a delivery.   A pregnant father and
a wise-cracking brainchild trying to get out.  And baby Athena burst
from her father’s forehead, giving big daddy Zeus the worst pregnancy
migraine of all time (ThinkQuest).  Moral of the story? Don’t get
pregnant if you’re a guy. But perhaps it was worth it, because with a
spark of brilliance and a hunger for innovation, Athena came out ready
to conquer the world.  From Hercules (Gill) to Odysseus (Kerestes),
Newton to Einstein, Gandhi to Teresa, and Gates to Jobs, Athena
defined genius helping her inventors and problem solvers,
revolutionize the world.  And the world looked forward, expecting a
new set of heroes who would battle a more monstrous set of problems.
And then, we arrived. My generation: a generation of APs, SATs, and
Facebook farming. Creativity? Out the window. So today, let’s explore
the problems facing our generation, ask ourselves where our creativity
has gone, and think of solutions to create inventors and leaders.
We live in a struggling world, a world of tsunamis, meltdowns
(“Japan”), revolts, deficits, and disasters. A world of 1 billion
hungry (“Global Hunger”), 1 billion illiterate (Boaz), and 1 billion
living on less than a dollar 25 cents a day (Shah). A world in which
humans will need two Earths to sustain their habits in just 40 years
(Damassa) and a world which by 2030 will invest in water as we today
invest in oil (Blain). A world of disease in which the United States
alone sees 1 out of every 4 people die of cancer (American Cancer
Society).
In this era of unimaginable problems, we need creativity of
unimaginable proportions –the creativity of a generation of kids to
tackle the problems that will devastate generations to come.  We need
not one, but one million Einsteins, one million Da Vincis, one million
Teresas.  But the majority of kids that this world so desperately
needs, haven’t learned how to create, invent, or solve.  We’ve
inherited a world that we may not be able to handle.
As Dan Meyers, in his Ted Conference speech “Math Class Needs a
Makeover” comments, we “expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in
22 minutes, three commercial breaks and a laugh track.”  We swallow
the problems and regurgitate the answers.
Sir Ken Robinson in his speech “Bring on the Learning Revolution” says
that school is “an industrial model of education, a manufacturing
model.”  In this 500 billion dollar system (National Center for
Education Statistics), we are thrown into the factory from one end,
hit with a flurry of facts, homework, and tests and come out
manufactured, mass-produced, memorized.  We torture our brains to find
what has already been found or discover what has already been
discovered; we memorize chemistry formula after formula, and analyze
history dates time after time again.  What the world is left with are
Henry Ford’s model T students, who come in every single color as long
as they’re bored and burned out.
Studies point to a nation wide creativity disaster.  Torrance
creativity tests, identified by Newsweek as a “gold standard in
creativity assessment” have shown that creativity in American students
has been on the decline (Bronson & Merryman).  Worse, the once great
leader of innovation has fallen to 21st in science and 25th in math
(The Board Foundation).
And yet – in our country we teach our kids the same way their
ancestors were taught a century ago (Wallis).  In our country, 35,000
students drop out of school every school week (Furger). Even my
brother’s thinking about dropping out and he’s only in 4th grade. In
our country and world, rather than think or read students Spark Note
at the rate of 2500 hits a second (Spark Notes) and shrink entire
epiphanies into the 140-character limit of Twitter.  The problem is
that we can’t solve poverty, global warming, or disease in just 140
characters. Today’s problems just don’t come with multiple-choice
solutions. As important as absorbing data is, in order to tackle new
problems, we need to learn to think.  When will we, as Ralph Waldo
Emerson puts it “walk on our own feet…work with our own hands… speak
our own minds” (qtd. in United States History).  Where is that genius,
that creativity… that spark of innovation? Athena, our great Greek
goddess of wisdom has been sleeping, and we need to wake her up – by
changing our schools, societies, and selves.
To think or not to think, that is the question. We need to think and
we must, as Hamlet would say, “take arms against a sea of troubles, /
and by opposing end them” (Lamb et al.). In Michigan’s Farmington
High, tinkering, thinking, and building is the curriculum.  According
to Time magazine, “calculus, physics, chemistry and engineering are
taught through activities that fill the hallways with a cacophony of
nailing, sawing and chattering …the kids…apply academic principles to
the real world” (Wallis). And while traditional education, books, and
tests are always essential, there should still be a problem to
solve. As MIT’s mathematician Seymour Papert puts it, mathematics
“started not as this…product of the abstract mind. It started as a way
of controlling the water of the Nile, building the pyramids, sailing a
ship” (qtd. in Curtis). When Lynbrook High School’s energetic science
teacher launched a research program (Cassidy), six students made it to
the Intel Science Talent Search semifinals ("Staff & Advisory Boards”)
with projects improving search engines, space exploration, and clean
energy (Noguchi). Such creative challenges, project-based learning, or
even giving extra credit for new ideas, not only brings the curriculum
home but creates thinkers who get excited about learning more. 
From science to history:  asking students how they would have founded
America, drafted the constitution, or run the country as Washington,
Lincoln, or Kennedy, inspires them to not only learn from history, but
learn how to make history. From history to English – reading
Shakespeare’s plays, Homer’s epics, and Hawthorne’s stories may
provide insights into life but having students create their own worlds
of poetry, mystery, or fantasy sparks creativity. And with creative
kids, even Akron, Ohio’s project-based learning school with 42% of
students in conditions of poverty, has become one of the top middle
schools of its city in test scores (Bronson & Merryman). When school
becomes a scientist’s laboratory, a writer’s desk, or a leader’s
podium, and mass-produces environments of exploring, dissecting, and
connecting the dots, there’s nothing stopping future innovations from
being made.  
From school to society, part two of our solution in which the
community participates in real-world, real-life, and real-time
education. Like California’s Collins Elementary School’s parent run
“Dissecting Machines” program (Samar "Your Article”) in which students
took donated (Samar “Collins Clubs”) computers, keyboards, and phones
apart (Samar "Your Article”) – discovering, for themselves, the
creative connections in real life contraptions. Like the few
organizations or parents that give micro grants to student
micro-preneurs for even starting or thinking about something new.
Encouragement and challenge inspires innovation.  It does after all,
take a village to raise a child.
And finally to home: part three of our solution, changing ourselves.
Rather than wait for decades to make a difference, we need to create
now. Like California’s Lawson Middle School environment club which
planted thousands of seeds to offer to community members for free
(GreenChipmunks' eClub "NewsFlash”) and launched a competitive walk to
school program to save the environment (GreenChipmunks' eClub
"Walk-One-Week (WOW)"). Like those middle school students, becoming a
citizen of the 21st century world means becoming immersed in its
problems -- and becoming aware of more than just what’s on
Facebook. More than ever, our generation is connected – but if we fail
to use the connectivity and the information on our fingertips, fail to
act, fail to think, and to fail to make, then we’ve failed as a
generation. We need to take risks, because the only time in our lives
when we can devote our energy to something big and still come home,
relaxed, to a dinner on the table and a basketball in the garage is
now. We need to create NOW.
Today’s model-T students may be manufactured and tested-out, but by
transforming our education from memorization to innovation at school
and at home we can tap Athena’s power.  Somewhere deep inside our
minds lie unrivaled intellects, unmatched imaginations, and
unimaginable ideas.  We need a generation of inventors, heroes, and
entrepreneurs. A generation to solve our monstrous problems. A
generation that follows the ancient saying: I create, therefore I am.
