Recently, I started thinking about the permutability of a language and how it applies to poetry. Word order is important and the right sequence of words can create emotion, surprise, and satisfaction. Some orderings are pleasing while others help a poet fit a structural form (for example, meter or rhyme). Some contribute emotionally (i.e. building suspense by saving the impactful word till the end) while others contribute to the poem's sound. Which word ordering to choose, however, is often constrained by the grammar of the language. A grammar which allows more word orderings (i.e. a language with more permutability) not only gives a poet freedom to explore aesthetics within the context of a particular concept or idea they've decided to express, but also makes it easier to fit structure and cadence. In Hindi, for example, the phrase "tum aaye yahan" (you came here) can also be written as "tum yahan aaye" (you here came),"yahan tum aye" (here you came), "yahan aaye tum" (here came you), "aaye tum yahan" (came you here), and "aaye yahan tum" (came here you). While my understanding of Hindi grammar is limited, most of these phrases would be acceptable in poetry, while in English, only "you came here" would pass unquestioned. 
  
Perhaps the permutability of a language is also related to how easy (or dare I say, fun) it is to write poetry in the language. Stepping back: what makes a language suitable for expression? And if a new language were being created - what words and rules would <i>you</i> choose for it and why? Would you ask for there to be specific phrases, so you could always capture how you feel? Or specific sounds you loved, so songs would always be soothing? Or words that sound the same, so your grandfathers could continue to make puns? Would you ask for many words or only very few?   
  
And one day, when the language you helped create intertwines itself with life, love, pain, and human experience, so much so that individuals take it upon themselves share experiences that the language couldn't fully capture (and start doing so in beautiful and suprising ways), how would the decisions you make today affect the poetry they create?
