Recently, I started thinking about permutability and how it applies to poetry! Poets ask themselves many questions related to order. Should my strongest word appear at the start or at the end? Is this word order more aesthetically pleasing than another? Can I change this word order to fit my rhyme scheme? Allowing more word orderings not only gives a poet freedom to explore aesthetics within the context of a particular concept or idea they've decided to express, but also makes it easier to fit structure and cadence. In Hindi, for example, the phrase "tum aaye yahan" (you came here) can also be written as "tum yahan aaye" (you here came),"yahan tum aye" (here you came), "yahan aaye tum" (here came you), "aaye tum yahan" (came you here), and "aaye yahan tum" (came here you). While my understanding of Hindi grammar is limited, most of these phrases would be acceptable in poetry, while in English, only "you came here" would pass unquestioned. I don't know if there is a "permutability" measure for a particular language, but if there is, perhaps it is related to how easy it is to be a poet of that language.

Stepping back: what makes a language suitable for expression? And if a new language were being created - what words and rules would <i>you</i> choose for it and why? Would you ask for there to be specific phrases, so you could always capture how you feel? Or specific sounds you loved, so songs would always be soothing? Or words that sound the same, so your grandfathers could continue to make puns? Would you ask for many words or only very few? 

And one day, when the language you helped create intertwines itself with life, love, pain, and human experience, so much so that individuals take it upon themselves share experiences that the language couldn't fully capture (and start doing so in beautiful and suprising ways), how would the decisions you make today affect the poetry they create?
