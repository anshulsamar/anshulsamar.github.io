Transcript of original speech on vegetarianism.

What do Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, and Bugs Bunny
have in common?  It is neither their widespread fame nor their ability
to look at any problem in a creative way… it is rather their choice to
become a vegetarian!
It amazing how we take care of the environment, buy hybrid cars to
reduce air pollution, keep the faucet off while brushing, but continue
to eat meat.  We worry about our health, workout in the gym, demand
for nutrition labels even on our water bottles, but continue to eat
meat.  Not just that, we love our cute, intelligent animals, hire
human “tasters” to test our dog food, protest animal cruelty, but
continue to eat meat.
If we truly want to save our environment, our health, and our animals,
we have to start thinking about one thing … Ladies and Gentlemen; it’s
all about what’s for dinner?
The livestock sector is one of the most significant contributors to
today’s most serious environmental problems. According to a 2006 UN’s
Livestock report, the livestock business worldwide generates more
greenhouse gases than all other forms of transportation combined
(Steinfeld et al xxi).  Raising one beef cow or steer produces 10,000
pounds of C02 in its lifetime, mostly released during the production
of the cow’s feed (Begley). To put this in perspective, a couple of
pounds of sizzling steak produce as much greenhouse gas as driving for
3 hours and leaving all the lights back home turned on (Begley).
We may like the aroma of meat, but the atmosphere doesn’t, and it’s
not just because of carbon dioxide.  Cows release gigantic amounts of
harmful methane from both ends of their digestive system… eww.  The
livestock sector accounts for more than 1/3rd of man-made methane
emissions in the world, a gas with 23 times the global warming
potential than carbon dioxide (Steinfeld et al xxi).
But Ronald McDonald doesn’t stop at the ozone. Producing one pound of
beef requires 2200 gallons of water – with most of the water being
used to grow the cow feed (Robbins 367).  This means that eating a
one-pound uses as much water as an average family of four taking a
month of showers… or just my sister taking a month of showers (“50
Water Facts and Conservation Tips”).  And ladies and gentlemen, that’s
just for one pound -- in United States we consume meat at the colossal
rate of 268 pounds of meat every year for every American  – or around
12 ounces of meat a person every single day (Bureau of Census).
Furthermore, almost a third of our Earth’s land is needed for
livestock grazing and to grow the colossal amounts of grain that our
livestock require (Steinfeld et al xxi).  To produce just 1 lb of beef
requires 28 lbs of corn, grain, and hay (“The Future of Food” 95;
Wulf).  15 million children or around 11 a second die from hunger
every year and around 800 million people are malnourished our corn and
grain continues to be eaten up by our livestock.   These children want
to know, what’s For Dinner?
Meat not only clogs our environment, it also clogs our hearts.
Cardiovascular disease, or heart disease, is the number one killer of
Americans taking around 871,000 lives in 2004 or almost 100 lives
every hour (American Heart Association 4).
One of the largest causes of our broken hearts is our consumption of
meat as it creates high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.
The saturated fat from meat doubles the risk of death from heart
disease for non-vegetarians compared to vegetarians (Robbins 19).  One
study of diet and blood pressure published by the American Dietetic
Association and the Dieticians of Canada shows that 42% of the meat
eaters had high blood pressure, compared to only 13% of vegetarians
(757).
Furthermore, Dr. William Castelli, the former director of the
Framingham Heart Study, a heart disease study running for over 50
years, says that “vegetarians have the best diet” and have the “lowest
rates of coronary disease of any group in the country” (qtd. in Elkins
62).
Before we bite into that juicy, meaty burger – let’s chew on this.
Animal based diets are high in fats and do not have the antioxidants
present in plants – one possible reason why meat eaters have high
risks of cancer.  A diet study of 149,000 people between the ages of
50 – 74 published in Journal of the American Medical Association in
2005 shows that those who ate just 2-3 oz a day of the most processed
red meat were 50% more likely to develop colon cancer (“Eating Lots of
Red Meat Linked to Colon Cancer”).  According to a CNN news article, a
similar diet study of 35,000 elderly women published in the Journal of
the American Medical Association and shows that diets which have a lot
of meat, animal fat, and hamburgers, can increase the risk of
developing lymph node cancer by 100% (Halsey).
And ladies and gentlemen, we can’t dismiss the benefits of a
plant-based diet as a bunch of baloney! Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a
nutritional biochemist at Cornell University, and the author of the
China Study, a comprehensive study over 20 years of health and
nutrition states that, “Vegetarians obtain plenty of calcium and
appear to have higher rates of bone density, which predisposes them to
lower rates of osteoporosis.”  He also states “the vast majority,
perhaps 80 percent to 90 percent, of all cancers, cardiovascular
diseases, and other forms of degenerative illness can be prevented, at
least until very old age, simply by adopting a plant-based diet”
(qtd. in Lang).  Ladies and gentlemen, What’s For Dinner?
As much as meat consumption decimates our environment and ruins our
health, as the old joke goes, it’s hard out there for a... cow.
Slaughterhouses and livestock farms aren’t exactly your neighborhood
parks.  Overcrowding, overfeeding, and keeping animals in miniscule
stalls for their whole life certainly make living horrendous but even
death doesn’t come easy.  According to a Washington Post article in
2001, squealing hogs are scalded and then dumped into hot water
(Warrik). Supposedly “stunned” cows hanging by one leg sometimes kick
and arch their backs to straight themselves up and show that they are
still alive – some even survive their tail being cut, belly ripped,
and hide pulled off (Warrik).  We cannot promote peace, love, and
non-violence and at the same time be cruelly slaughtering these
innocent animals just to satisfy our tastes.  Even Socrates has said
"The highest realms of thought are impossible to reach without first
attaining an understanding of compassion” (qtd. in “Food for
Thought”). Ladies and gentlemen, What’s For Dinner?
Out of all of those skilled at the art of deception, meat takes the
spot as the ultimate master. It charms us with its tastes, intoxicates
us with its stomach-grumbling aromas, and lures us with its “apparent”
nutritional value making us forget that meat has a dark, or rather
rotten side as well. 
This meat has been devouring our earth, our hearts and our health all
along.  This age old habit must be looked at with a fresh perspective!
Now I am not asking to cut your meat intake cold turkey.   Habits are
hard to change, but we can moderate our meat intake bit-by-bit,
bite-by-bite.  Even the chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, says that people should have
one meat-free day per week to cut greenhouse gases (qtd. in
Juliette).  And chopping out a day of meat is not going to shrink our
protein intake… in fact, in America our average protein intake is
already double of what’s recommended (Rice 54).  And according to the
American Institute of Cancer Research, one should eat no more than 18
oz of red meat a week (“Limit Consumption of Red Meats (such as beef,
pork and lamb) and Avoid Processed Meats”).   
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a choice to make for our environment,
our health, and our animals.  
Let’s chop out our pork chops, slice down our steaks, and beef up our
vegetables.  
Let’s cut back on meat by simply ordering differently at restaurants,
and eating meat as a side dish instead of the main one.
Let’s use meat substitutes, and try vegetarian recipes from around the
world.  Instead of garnishing our meat with parsley, let’s garnish our
salads with small bits of meat… and perhaps even eat some animal
crackers. 
From Meatless Mondays and Salad Sundays, Veggie Wednesday and Fruity
Fridays, help preserve our environment, keep up our health, and be
compassionate to our animals.    
Tonight at home, let’s ask ourselves the question that Isaac Newton,
Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstein, and Bugs Bunny asked themselves
every night.  Ladies and gentlemen, what’s for dinner?

There is something wildly exciting about living in an all frosh dorm.

To begin with, the kids are ridiculous. Our dorm includes physics
geniuses, musicians, cooks, dancers, writers, a 15 year old (already
in college), a photographer of royal blood (some great-great-great^10

at home named Voldemort and Darth Vader.  We also have someone whose
family dreams about having their teeth fall out, two fencers (whom
I’ve made sure in self-defense to become friends with - one of them
will that say she beats me at pool, but I go easy because I don't want
a saber stuck through my gut), and a floor of guys for whom ping pong
is a secret way of existence.

The kids are ridiculous - but the dorm, equally so. We're madly in
love with billiards and singing “I’ll make a man out of you” at 2 AM
in the morning. We sip "Tea with the PHE" (our peer health educator)
weekly and practice whistling acapella (Stanford's newest underground
whistling acapella group in the nonexistent underground whistling
acapella scene).  We hoard candy, find steam tunnels, and climb
roofs. There’s always some question on the first floor white board
(“Who was your starter pokemon?" "Vote yes for Stanford Separatist
Movement." "Rank the 1st Floor in Ping Pong Rankings."). Third floor
is playing Secret Santa, first floor is playing white elephant, and
who knows what the all girls second floor is doing. It's too quiet for
studying going on, so I think they are planning a massive invasion of
the neighboring dorm Soto.

We're taking classes from “Humor in Music” to “Trapeze” and on a
single night, we crack at code and pull hair out over chemistry. We
shower each other at midnight on birthdays and yell "T-R-A-N-C-O-S
Trancos is the f***ing best every time" our “Tramily” rolls out. We
wear formal clothes in the mess hall on "Formal Fridays" to make
everyone else in the dining halls look underdressed.

And yet, in all of this hubbub, there is togetherness. There is a
family. In the late night conversations and pillow talk and moments
between pool games, there is a friendship - the kind that I wasn’t
used to forming so quickly in high school. I often thought that
closeness takes time, but when you live with 80 other people, you have
no choice but to make each other your own.

We learn together and live together. For many of us, the transition to
college has been a difficult process - academically and culturally.
But you know a place has become your home when you start dreaming
about it when you really home over break - even if the dream involves
you having a 6 - 0 lead in ping pong over your close Singaporean
friend who has beaten you every ping pong game in the last 8 weeks.

There’s something about coming back to the dorm at 2:30 AM and finding
Trancos in the same condition as you left it at 10 PM. The same Disney
music, the same hair tearing, the same pool games, and the same
Tramily.

Trancos <3 and Tramily forever.
