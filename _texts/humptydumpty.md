*Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall,*  
*Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,*  
*All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,*  
*Couldn’t put Humpty together again.*  

**Humpty Dumpty’s Neighbor:**

It’s been hard on the family.  
The little one’s been asking  
for her big brother.  
What are they supposed to tell her,  
that he just left?  
That he didn’t say goodbye?  

**Politician:**

Little is known about  
the tragic fall and even less  
about our helpless king.  
Did he really think horses  
would make for good doctors?  
I have said this before  
and will say it again:  
“Your Majesty, tear down this wall.”  

**Journalist:**

Tragedy, indeed, but  
one is pressed to wonder,  
whether he fell backwards or forwards?  
What caught Humpty’s eye?  
What startled him?  
Did he leap or stumble upon his death?  

**Humpty Dumpty:**

I was not startled by what I saw,  
but rather by what I did not.  
How can you put yourself back together  
once you’ve seen that beyond the wall,  
there is simply nothing?
