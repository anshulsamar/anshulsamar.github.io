I recently completed a 3 quarter, 30 week self imposed program with
Stanford's Diversity and First-Gen Office. The program started fall
quarter when I took Psychology 103: Intergroup Communication. I then
trained to facilitate it in the winter and finally was one of 16 TAs
this last spring. 

In Psych 103, a hundred students
meet Tuesday and Thursday evening to discuss race, gender, income, and sexual orientation. Each unit,
subgroups sit in the center of the room and are questioned by
groups surrounding them. In the race unit, subgroups include the
Black, White, Native, Mixed, Latinx, Asian, MENA groups, while groups for
income are low, middle, and high. Questions are formed and voted on prior to
this fishbowl and are posed anonymously to the members of the group
inside. Students are then asked to share their opinions and experiences. "Would
you be okay if your child came out as gay?" "Do you feel safe at
Stanford?" "What does being a man mean to you?" "Do you hold any
stereotypes over your own race?" "What is the richest thing you've ever done?" 

Along with in class fishbowls, small sections of 12 students
meet weekly to debrief their experiences and have more intimate
discussions. Every unit consists of mandatory readings and
reflections. Students go on walks together and are
required to meet one on one with someone who isn't part of their
group. Each class ends not with a call to action, but a call to
question - and
a call to see consequence, not in headlines or 
textbooks, but behind the eyes of *real* students. 



There are 4 units, 10 weeks, 20 class meetings, and countless
conversations. Many continue on until the night as students leave to
the bike racks and head back to their dorms.  

Students learn. They have to. The process is built this
way - exhilarating and often, painful. The students on the outside sit
circled around, listening to the fishbowl of 10 - 15
students. These are students who talk like them, look like 
them, and act just like them, but whose life stories and experiences 
are wildly different.

Inside the fishbowl, students are sharing. Some look down at
the carpet while others speak out. There are nods and verbal
acknowledgements and also silence. The quietness pleads, as if to say,
"these are the shoes I walk in, I have no other pair but my own." 

[//]: # If our instuititions accepted anger in lieu of
[//]: # privelege, perhaps things would be different. 

While reactions are not allowed from the outside group, there are
plenty to go around. There is suprise when members of the Black group talk about
biking while black. There is
hurt when the gender unit begins with three groups, but discussions
mostly concern two. There is anger when members of the high income
group use their parent's low income stories as their own. These
reactions and others - ranging from colorism and colonialism to
arranged marriage and parenting - are shared in section, reflection, one on
ones, and end of unit debriefs.

If our institutions accepted anger in lieu of privilege, perhaps
this work and this class would not be needed. But instead, we ask all
students - especially those learning of these issues for the first time - to lean into the
discomfort and look into their own minds. For most of our lives, 
education has been in one direction. For the first time, we are taking
thoughts out - observing every word, every belief and asking, “why
is this here? Should it still be?”

[//]: #The lack of latter is accompanied
[//]: # by the abundance of the former and understandably so. Butalong withanger, there is plently of reflection.
[//]: # One might even go so far to say that there are two types of
[//]: # students graduating from Stanford this year - those who are angry and there are those who are not angry yet. 

[//]: # - because in Psych 103 students and staff,
[//]: # there is no dearth of the former.  Those on the other end are pushed
[//]: # to look into our own minds.

[//]: # It is odd looking into our own minds. 

Every Tuesday and Thursday, something subtle is
celebrated at Stanford. Vulnerability. Diversity. Acknowledgement. And
the privilege
to be able to say: "I understand. What's next?"
