I recently completed a 3 quarter, 30 week program with Stanford's
Diversity and First-Gen Office. The program started Autumn quarter when I took
Psychology 103: Intergroup Communication. I then trained to facilitate
it in the winter and finally was one of 16 TAs this last spring.

In Pysch 103, a hundred students
meet Tuesday and Thursday evening to discuss race, gender, income, and sexual orientation. Each unit,
subgroups sit in the center of the room and are questioned by
groups surrounding them. Subgroups for race, for example, include the
Black, White, Native, Latinx, Asian, MENA groups, while groups for
income are low, middle, and high. Questions are formed and voted on prior to
this fishbowl and are posed anonymously to the members of the group
inside. Students raise their hand and share their experiences. "Would
you be okay if your child came out as gay?" "Do you feel safe at
Stanford?" "What does being a man mean to you?" "Do you hold any
stereotypes over your own race?" "What is the richest thing you've ever done?" 

Smaller sections of 12 students
also meet weekly to debrief their experiences and have more intimate
discussions and activities. Every unit consists of mandatory readings and
reflections. Students go on walks together and are
required to meet one on one with someone who isn't part of their
group.

There are 4 units, 10 weeks, 20 class meetings, and countless
conversations. Many continue on until the night as students leave to
the bike racks and head back to their dorms.  

Students learn. They have to. The process is built this
way - exhilarating and sometimes, painful. The students on the outside, sit
quietly circled around, looking down at the fishbowl of 10 - 15
students. These are students who talk like them, look like 
them, and act just like them, but whose life stories and experiences 
are wildly different.

Inside the fishbowl, students are sharing. Some look down at
the carpet while others speak loudly and out, 
offering emotions and life stories. There are nods and laughter and
quiet acknowledgements. At times, the silence is pleading, as if to
say: "These are the shoes I walk in, I have no other pair but my own."

There is rage, too. Like when the straight group responds to "Would you date someone who was
transgender?" Or when the high income group uses their parent's low income
stories as their own. Or when the gender unit has three, but mostly ends up
being about two. 

It is rather odd looking into our own minds. For most of our lives,
education has been in one direction. For the first time, we are taking
thoughts out. Observing at every word, every belief and asking - "Why is
this here? Should it still be?" 

Every Tuesday and Thursday, something subtle is being
celebrated at Stanford. Vulnerability. Diversity. The ability to be
wrong. The acknowledgement that not everything is ok. The recognition of
how privileged we are to be able to be here and to say: "I
understand. What next?" 

Psych 103 ends not with a call to action, but a call to question. A
call to curiosity. And a call to see consequence, not in headlines or
textbooks, but behind the eyes and in the hands of *real* students. 

My deepest gratitude to all the students in Psych 103 this quarter for
an experience I'll never forget. Thanks to our teaching team Dereca,
Danny, Hazel, and Gabriela; my facilitation instructor,
Danny; my TA partner, Tracy, and my section and all my fellow TAs. Some pictures below:
