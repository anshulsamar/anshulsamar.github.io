I recently completed a 3 quarter, 30 week series with
Stanford's Diversity and First-Gen Office. I started fall
quarter when I took Psychology 103: Intergroup Communication. I then
trained to facilitate it in the winter and finally was one of 16 TAs
this last spring. 

In Psych 103, a hundred students
meet Tuesday and Thursday evening to discuss race, gender, income, and sexual orientation. Each unit,
subgroups sit in the center of the room and are questioned by
groups surrounding them. In the race unit, subgroups include the
Native, Black, Latinx, Mixed, Asian, White, and Middle East and North African groups, while groups for
income are low, middle, and high. Questions are formed and voted on prior to
this fishbowl and are posed anonymously to the members of the group
inside. Students are then asked to share their opinions and experiences. "Would
you be okay if your child came out as gay?" "Do you feel safe at
Stanford?" "What does being a man mean to you?" "Do you hold any
stereotypes over your own race?" "What is the richest thing you've ever done?" 

Along with in class fishbowls, small sections of 12 students
meet weekly to debrief their experiences and have more intimate
discussions. Every unit consists of mandatory readings and
reflections. Students go on walks together and are
required to meet one on one with someone who identifies with another
group. 

There are 4 units, 10 weeks, 20 class meetings, and countless
conversations. Many continue into the night as students leave to
the bike racks and head back to their dorms.  

Students learn. A lot. The process is built this
way - exhilarating and painful. The students on the outside sit
circled around, listening to the fishbowl of 10 - 15
students. These are students who talk like them, look like 
them, and act just like them, but whose life stories and experiences 
are wildly different.

Inside the fishbowl, students are sharing. Some look down at
the carpet while others speak out. There are nods and verbal
acknowledgements, but also silence. The quietness is heavy, as if to
say: "these are the shoes I walk
in, I have no other pair but my own."

[//]: # privelege, perhaps things would be different. 
[//]: #“If marginalization could somehow be the lack of priveledge
[//]: #could somehow be compensated by an abundance of anger, our campus 
[//]: #would be a better place - but sadly, there is no
[//]: #If an abundance of anger could make up for the shortage of privelege,
[//]: #perhaps things would be easier

While reactions are not allowed during the fishbowl, there are
plenty to go around. There is surprise when members of the Black group talk about
biking while black. There is
hurt when the gender unit begins with three groups, but discussions
mostly concern two. There is anger when members of the high income
group talk about their understanding of wealth. These
reactions, on everything from colorism and colonialism to
arranged marriage and parenting, are shared in section and debriefs. 

[//]: # It is hard work - especially for those, on whose backs and stories,
[//]: # the rest of us grow and learn. But in a country whose president
[//]: # explains away entire races and groups in one hundred and fourty characters - *real* stories become important. Complex,
[//]: # interwoven, and incredibly diverse. *listening* and *learning* becomes
[//]: # important.   listening to diversity
[//]: # is not only important 

If our institutions accepted anger in lieu of privilege, perhaps
things would be different. But instead, students in Psych 103 lean
into discomfort. Usually in school, thoughts and ideas
flow inwards. In Psych 103, students take
them out, asking, “Why
is this here? Should it still be?”

[//]: #The lack of latter is accompanied
[//]: # by the abundance of the former and understandably so. Butalong withanger, there is plently of reflection.
[//]: # One might even go so far to say that there are two types of
[//]: # students graduating from Stanford this year - those who are angry and there are those who are not angry yet. 

[//]: # - because in Psych 103 students and staff,
[//]: # there is no dearth of the former.  Those on the other end are pushed
[//]: # to look into our own minds.

[//]: # It is odd looking into our own minds. 

Every Tuesday and Thursday, something subtle is
celebrated at Stanford. Vulnerability. Diversity. The ability to be wrong. And
the privilege
to be able to say: "I understand. What's next?"

Psych 103 ends not with a call to action, but a call to
question - and
a call to see consequence, not in headlines or 
textbooks, but behind the eyes of *real* students.

*[1] My gratitude to all the students in Psych 103 for
this experience. Thanks to our teaching team Dereca,
Danny, Hazel, and Gabriela; my facilitation instructor,
Danny; my TA partner, Tracy, my section, and the other
TAs.*

*[3] Critique: As with any program, there is room for
 critique, but unlike most other programs, the Psych 103
 professors actively seek it. While I am no longer
 involved with it, were I to organize or do it again, I would add
 units on ability (including health/chronic health issues) and
 spirituality/religion. I would also put more emphasis on theoretical
 frameworks for understanding power and privelege. I would also devote
 time to empowering students and discussing `what's next.' I also often felt a need to choose and claim an
 identity and to allow it to define me, when identity-based
 understanding is quite different from the way I (at least spiritually) approach myself. I think students can learn that the world
 views them under certain identities without feeling pressured to
 label or box their own self.*  

*[3] Disclaimer: this is based solely on my own experience with
 Psych103. Due to the units that we chose, I was many a time part of the
 more priveleged group. The experience of students who were in
 marginalized groups was likely very different.*
