I recently completed a 3 quarter, 30 week program with Stanford's
Diversity and First-Gen Office. The program started autumn quarter when I took
Psychology 103: Intergroup Communication. I then trained to facilitate
it winter quarter and finally was one of 16 TAs this last spring.

In Pysch 103, a hundred students
meet Tuesday and Thursday after dinner to have discussions around
four units: race, gender, income, and sexual orientation. In each unit,
subgroups sit in the center of the room and are questioned by
groups surrounding them. Subgroups for race, for example, include the
Black, White, Native, Latinx, Asian, MENA groups, while for sexual
orientation, are straight and LGBTQ+. Questions are formed and voted on prior to
the fishbowl and are posed anonymously to the members of the group
inside. Students raise their hand and share their experiences. "Would
you be okay if your child came out as gay?" "Do you feel safe at
Stanford?" "What does being a man mean to you?" "Do you hold any
stereotypes over your own race?" "What is the richest thing you've ever done?" 

Smaller sections of 12 students
also meet weekly to debrief their experiences and have more intimate
discussions and activities. Every unit consists of mandatory readings and
reflections. Students go on walks together and are
required to meet one on one with someone who isn't part of their
group.

There are 4 units, 10 weeks, 20 class meetings, and countless
conversations. Many which start in class and continue as students
leave to the bike racks or back to their dorms. 

Students learn. They have no choice but to. The process is built this
way - exhilirating and painful. The students on the outside, sit
quietly circled around, looking down at the fishbowl of 10 - 15
students. These are students who talk like them, look like 
them, and act just like them - but whose life stories and experiences 
are wildly different. The students inside are sharing. 
Some look down at the carpet while others speak loudly and out -
baring their emotions and lives. There are nods. There
is often laughter. But the silence between the answers is almost
pleading - as if to say, "Listen. These are the shoes I walk
in, I have no other pair but my own." 

There was rage, too. Like when the straight group responded to "Would you date someone who was
transgender?" Or when the high income group used their parent's low income
stories as their own. Or when the gender unit had three, but ended up
mostly being about two. Or when the class finished and we wondered
whether this was worth it. 

It is exhausting fighting against our own minds. For our entire lives,
education has been in one direction. For the first time, we are taking
thoughts out. Cleaning up. Looking at every word, every prejudice,
every belief and asking - "Why is this here? Should it still be?"

Every Tuesday and Thursday, something subtle is being
celebrated at Stanford. Vulnerability. Diversity. The ability to be
wrong. The acceptance that not everything is ok. The recognition of
how priveledged we are to be able to be here and to say: "I
understand. What next?" 

Psych 103 ends not with a call to action, but a call to question.
A call to curiosity. A call to see consequence and life not in between
some words on a page, but behind the eyes and in the hands of
**real** students.

I almost graduated without this experience. Most at Stanford will.

-------------

It is remarkable how much I've learned over the last year through this
process. It feels wrong to have almost graduaed without it. How can I
call myself a "data scientist" without having even taken a second look
at all the biases and prejudices that I held?

-----------


It is
wrong most will graduate graduating
without it. And it *is* wrong that so many Stanford engineers will
graduate

Exhaustion when students found themselves in
marginalized groups, again and again. A fri

Frustration that comes out in section,
in written reflection. Many are too scared to say what they really
believe. And many finding themselves in marginalized groups and having
to explain themselves, again and again, become exhausted.

Students come face to face with raw stories and vulnerability. They
face to face with their own beliefs and assumptions about the world. 
Eyes are opened. Priveledge is recognized. There is an overwhelming
understanding of how much wrong there is in the world - and a
realization of how little is being done to fix it.

And at the same time, how much there is to celebrate.

who graduate and
quickly - at least the valley - move to positions of power, will leave
without ever having seriously considered the biases, prejudices,
discrimination, and oppression at play in the spaces they occupy.

Thanks to the internet, you can read and learn about the experiences
of so many individuals. They are raw, striking, and 

From why we share pronouns? what is wrong with color blindness?
how does money impact low income students at Stanford? to thoughts on
affirmative action, model minority myth, masculinity, queer experiences

*In the race unit, for example, I participatd in the South Asian group, I (along with the
other students present) were asked if we ever dealt with issues around
color and complexion, whether we had felt excluded during
conversations about race, whether we would date or someone of a
different race, what we thought about arranged marriage, and what
experiences we had with misperceptions because we were South Asian.*

It's spring cleaning at Stanford and before you know it, you're being
worked on in every direction. The readings, the talks, the outbursts,
the repeated push to be willing to be wrong. How else, you can imagine
them saying, will you know you are right?

1. Race: Native, Black, Latinx, White, Middle Eastern and North African, East
and South East Asian, Mixed, and South Asian*
2. Sexual Orientation: Straight, Queer et al.
3. SES: Low Income, Middle Income, High Income
4. Gender: Man, Woman, and (shouting emoji)F***...?
