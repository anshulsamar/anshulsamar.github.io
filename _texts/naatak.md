These last few months, I've been part of Naatak, an Indian theater
company in the Bay Area. I had taken a few theater classes in college,
but this was my first time acting in a full length
production. Grateful to our director and script adapter, for giving me an opportunity to be part of
this play, and to such a hardworking and a wonderful cast and crew! I
was blown away by how much work the props and set team did behind the
scenes for this production. My biggest thanks to all of my family and
friends who came out to support. Thanks to friends from Hindi Club,
Stanford, Bellarmine, Cerebras, and special special thanks to Shailee
Samar and Sharvari Bhide for their hilarious posters! It really means a
whole lot to have so many well wishers in the audience.

<i>Manolo Costazuela, in Naatak's adaptation of Neil Simon's The Odd
Couple. Manolo is a romantic airline administrator born to an Indian
mother and Spanish father. He is sexy, charming, and when it comes to
matters of the heart - a little emotional. While he still misses his
ex wife, he can't help but be smitten by two beautiful neighbors
downstairs. And sure, there are a few language barriers - but they are
nothing Manolo and his elder brother can't handle.</i>

The play centers around two friends, Geeta and Suman, who decide to
live together, but quickly start getting on each other's nerves. The
following hour and a half of showtime has plenty of comedy - with a
cranky Geeta, sad Suman, confused group of friends, and two single,
recently divorced neighbors upstairs (Manolo and his elder brother,
Jesus).

GEETA : [into phone] Well, personally I think she’s taking it very
well.

SUMAN : I am not taking it well. मेरी हालत देख रही हो?(Don't you see my condition)

GEETA : [ on the phone, warmly ] Oh, मैं जानती हूँ तुमने कोशिश की है. (I know
you tried.)  Bless
you.

SUMAN : What do you mean “Bless You”? Don’t “Bless Him”!!

GEETA : [ to SUMAN ] उसे छींक आ गयी थी (He had to sneeze!). Will you
calm down?

Note that the article incorrectly characterizes Manolo/Jesus - in this
Naatak adaptation they are of Indian-Spanish origin.

As exciting as it was to be part of a production, it came with its own
challenges!  

Theater requires passion and is a very high risk art! 4 months of preparation for 4 shows takes many
personalities working towards a single goal and it takes an
experienced director to be able to bring out the artist in everyone
involved. Good theater is also proof that two artists are better than
one. So much is required to put on a production -
from rehearsals, to blocking, to props, to costumes, to an entire
constructed set, and actually getting people to come and watch the
play! It's amazing how much love and energy members of the
Naatak community put into their productions, even if they are not
acting or in the limelight. The humility and dedication is inspiring!

I also learned how theater intersects with
ethics. One of my roles at Stanford was facilitating conversations
around race, gender, sexual orientation, and income along with
mentoring younger students. In my training for this, I learned how
much of a negative impact even well intentioned words can have. After
talking to other students different than me, I learned how even simple
phrases can reinforce stereotypes. Words have impact and I
think it is important to take responsibility for everything said on
stage - or to at least callout the stereotypes used and make the audience think deeply about their
views of the world. 

Many dialogues in this 1985 play ought to have been changed. When I
raised concerns over the characterization
around suicide, my discomfort around racist material/jokes, 
and disapproval over statements involving sexual orientation or gender identity, I was told,
in short, that Naatak's job was to entertain, not teach, and the jokes were
OK in context. And while, to the credit of the theater leadership, some changes were made, many were not. The belief was that if
you have to portray a character who says something offensive, that’s OK: it is the character who is offensive, not you. I understand this
point of view, but don't necessarily share it. If your story absolutely
needs a character who says something racist/misogynistic/etc,
it ought to be done with skill and
awareness, so that the audience understands the impact of what is
being said and why it is not okay. The director, playwright, and
actors need to take responsibility for the wordview they share on
stage. For my Naatak friends
reading this post and adapting new plays, I hope you can consider the
hidden impact of the script! Especially in the
South Asian community, it is critical to have conversations around suicide (and offering support and care to those like The Odd Couple’s
Suman) , race (without stereotyping other non-white minorities such as
Manolo/Jesus), and gender identity/sexual orientation (without making
heterosexuality and cisgenderedness the norm). Naatak’s audience will
soon grow beyond older South Asian generation to also include the
younger South Asian community and these new patrons may call for
different ways of thinking about theater! 

Thanks for a great experience!
