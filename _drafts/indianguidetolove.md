Your grandmother wants you married (you’re 28, but hey, your
 grandmother got married at 15, so age doesn’t really matter). She
 originally wanted you married to a Brahmin, and then just a Hindu,
 but because you’re an American born Indian whose friends have names
 like John, Rebecca, and Isabelle, she’s OK as long as you marry an
 Indian. You know there are like half a billion of them, but still. An
 Indian girl? God damn. Maybe if you’d been dating an ethnically
 ambiguous Mexican girl, everyone would have been happy - but you’re
 not dating an ethnically ambiguous Mexican girl. This girl is from a
 country which used to be India; in fact, the one thing your
 grandmother warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive,
 was you dating a girl from a country which used to be India. I’ll
 jump from the roof, she promised. And, of course, you swore you
 wouldn’t do it. You swore you wouldn’t. You swore you wouldn’t.

And you did.

Your grandmother? She’ll be very quiet for three weeks and will find a
 pundit who says that this is an astrologically a bad time. It’ll make
 sense because you’ve both gone through so much together - your
 father’s accident, your college admission, her seven year long fear
 you were gay. And because love, a grandmother’s love, is not so
 easily shed. Over a torturous 20 hour flight you travel together from
 California to Dehli and then from Dehli into Rajasthan.
 On the way home, you see a Hindustani boy with a white
 girl and so giddy with love that you wonder whether he’s even told
 his parents. Your grandmother says nothing. Later, while making
 chapatis, she cries.
 
For the next month, you try everything you can. You wake up in the
morning. You join her for morning walks. You dictate every whatsapp
forward aloud. You stop complaining about ghee. You blame America. You blame
India. You blame the British. You tell her you’re not really
dating. You tell her you were never really ever dating. That you are
no longer dating. You try it all, but one day she simply sits on your
bed and says no, no more, and shows you a picture of Shashi Masi’s
sister in law’s best friend’s niece.

For a while, you wander the city. You see photos of your ex with
another brown man and tell your friends your grandmother was probably
right. It wouldn’t have worked out anyways. Besides, doesn’t
infatuation die down soon enough? “Real love happens after marriage,”
your grandmother says. “It’s how it has always been.” You nod. In your
family, that’s the only sort you’ve seen.

You tell your grandmother you’ll give it a shot. You call a rickshaw
to the girl’s house. You meet the girl. You meet her parents. You meet
her uncles and her aunts. You make small talk. 

But back home, you say you aren’t ready. You remind her you are only 28. But your grandmother sits you down and makes it plain: I’m getting
old, she says.

For some Indian kids that wouldn’t mean shit.

But you were never that kind of kid.
