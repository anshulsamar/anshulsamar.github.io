In a quiet end to an exciting 13+ year journey, we sold the last
Elementeo Chemistry Card Game on Amazon on December 27th, 2018. I still
remember my parent's garage being filled with the first manufactured
shipment of games back in 2008. When I was in middle school, the prototypes
used to be printed at the local FedEx Kinkos and element and
compound characters drawn by hand. I poured through endless library
books to learn about the elements in hopes to bring them to life. With
the help of some exceptional artists, these elements were given faces
and personalities. Cards were printed and boxes were assembled in a
factor and games were tested with kids. Soon, Amazon had contacted us about
partnering with them and we were shipping games across the country.

Short snippet about Elementeo:

<i>The Elementeo Chemistry Card Game (v2) brings elements, compounds,
chemistry, and science to life. Elementeo includes five different
levels (element, reaction, compound, alchemy, and fusion) and has 50
elements, 25 compounds, and 25 alchemy cards, not to mention blank
cards for you to create characters of your own. The goal of the game
is to cross the field, capture your opponent’s electrons, and reduce
them to zero. Elementeo (V2) can be played by 2 – 4 people and is
recommended for kids of ages 8 and above.</i>

haven't taken it down yet :)

I spoke about how Elementeo was made in a talk <a

we launched at that event is no longer available, but this is what it
looked like:

Theodore Gray even let us use some of his awesome 3D videos of real
elements for it.

There are too, too many people to thank. In no particular order:

1. Sandra McGonagle and Jon Entous for believing in a sixth grader who was really into
card games
2. California Association of Gifted for trusting me with $500 to
develop Elementeo
3. TiE, a Silicon Valley nonprofit and advisors Satish Gupta,
Jayaram Bhat, Ravi Amble for their business advice, constant encouragement, and sponsorship at TieCon
4. Allison Tilley at Pillsbury for their probono services and helping us incorporate Alchemist
Empire, Inc
5. Theodore Gray for advice on chemistry to business and being an
incredible mentor (check out his website periodictable.com)
6. Amazon, Exploratorium, MIT Museum, Educational Innovations, and Rainbow
Resource for carrying Elementeo
7. Alsop Louie Partners and Gilman Louie, Corey Reese, Eli Chait, and
Ricky Yean for their wisdom, never ending encouragement and treating me like an
entrepreneur and not a teenager
8. Peter Adkison and Hidden City Games for their sage advice on
manufacturing and designing card games
10. My family who are far happier than I am that the old days of
editing, shipping boxes, and driving me places are over
12. Davidson Institute for their encouragement and $25,000 Davidson
Fellowship for Elementeo
13. American Chemical Society, National Academies of Sciences, American
Chemical Society Puerto Rico, Maker Faire, National Association of
Gifted Children, Lyceum, TEDx San Jose, and many others for hosting us
14. Sean Seal, Enroc, White Lions, Cara Nilsen, Massive Brain,
Ginormous Industries, Deborah Saez, Webgrity, and Cartamundi USA: the best artists
and designers and manufacturers I could have asked for.
