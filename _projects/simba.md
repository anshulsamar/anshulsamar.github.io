Simba is a mac application to track pedestrians and faces in
 video. I developed this as an extension of OpenTLD, adding multi-threading support
 and integrating various open source detection algorithms into a easy
 to use mac application (anshulsamar.github.io/simba). Users input
 videos, add bounding boxes, and query the system for tracking information.

I also made a separate query tool to play tracks:

This was a joint project between Stanford Vision Lab and Stanford
Language and Cognition Lab. Thanks to Guido Pusiol for mentorship and
help. Advised by Guido Pusiol and Michael Frank.
